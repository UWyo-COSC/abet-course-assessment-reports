# Evaluation Overview

The program evaluation proceeds by considering the program **student outcomes** 
and creating one or more **key performance indicators (KPIs)** for each outcome.  
Each KPI is assessed by one or more courses in the **core sequence**, which is
required of all Computer Science majors. Note: Only computer science majors are
assessed in these courses, so if students from other majors take one of the
courses in our core sequence, their performance does not affect the assessment
results. Student performance is broken down into the following categories:

* **Excelled:** Student work demonstrates clear and irrefutable evidence that the 
  student has fully learned and integrated the given skill. 
* **Mastered:** Student work demonstrates sufficient evidence that the student has 
  fully learned the given skill, but perhaps has not integrated it in the context 
  of his or her other computing skills. 
* **Partially Mastered:** Student work demonstrates mixed evidence that the student 
  has learned at least a portion of the given skill.
* **Below Expectations:** Student work demonstrates no evidence that the student has 
  learned at least any portion of the given skill.

Students who are categorized as **Excelled** or **Mastered** are considered to
have **satisfied** the corresponding KPI for the purpose of assessment. We assess 
each KPI by keeping a historical record of the proportion of students who satisfy
the KPI at each assessment cycle, typically no more than two years.  The assessment
for each KPI is then aggregate into an assessment for the associated student outcome.
This aggregation is performed using an average that is weighted by the number of
student assessments (or distinct observations).

## Student Outcomes

The official list of student outcomes for the Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Wyoming can be found in the 
[Course Catalog](http://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/university_catalog/5encosc.html), 
and in the [Department of Computer Science web pages](http://www.uwyo.edu/cosc/current_students/undergraduate-students/abet/index.html).
They are replicated here for convenience:

> The program of study in Computer Sci­ence enables students to achieve, by the time of graduation:
>
> (1) Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
> (2) Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
> (3) Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
> (4) Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
> (5) Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.
> (6) Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.

The KPIs are discussed and assessed (bold) in the following courses:

The assessment plan is closely tied to the **core courses**
in the program, since these courses must be taken by all of
our students, regardless of their concentration.  This can
be seen in the following chart, which summarizes the 
assessment plan of all key performance indicators.

Core Course                             | KPIs                        | Outcomes

## Evaluation Schedule Master Plan

We have devised a testing cycle that spreads data collection into two-year cycles.
The undergraduate committee meets yearly to analyze the latest assessment data and
offer suggestions for improvement.
We are currently scheduling COSC 3020 yearly, because students
continue to struggle, but it will convert into a two-year cycle in the future.

Core Course                             | Assessed
:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------
COSC 3011: Software Design              | Every other year, starting 2020-21
COSC 3020: Algorithms & Data Structures | Yearly (eventually every other year)
COSC 3050: Ethics                       | Every other year, starting 2020-21
COSC 4950: Senior Design I              | Every other year, starting 2021-22
COSC 4955: Senior Design II             | Every other year, starting 2021-22
