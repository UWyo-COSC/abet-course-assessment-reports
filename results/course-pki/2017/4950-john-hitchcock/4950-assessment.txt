Hi Ruben,

Here's what I was able to come up with for senior design last year. Most of the KPIs were not specifically measured, so I matched them as best I could with assignments and based the data below on grades. There are a few KPIs where we have no relevant data, so I left those at 0 students assessed.

We'll be able to assess all of these this year. Sorry there's not better data for last year.

John

John & Mike,

I need you to collect some ABET data for me. To be clear, this is CRUCIAL and I need it done as soon as possible.

Specifically, I need you to use the information from the past year of teaching 4950/5 and give me information on each of the following:

4950, John — was 3 KPIs, now 2

(c.1) Identify constraints on the design problem 
(c.2) Establish acceptance criteria for a solution

4955, John — was 13 KPIs, now 11

(c.3) Design the selected solution for a given problem 
(c.4) Implement the designed solution for a given problem 
(c.5) Evaluate the implemented solution
(d.1) Listen to other team members 
(d.2) Actively discuss team projects, objectives, or challenges with other team members
(d.3) Fulfill team duties on time 
(d.4) Share in the work of the team 
(d.5) Research and gather information
(f.1) Write technical reports 
(f.2) Present technical material to technical peers 
(f.3) Present technical material to non-technical visitors

For each one of those, you need to tell me:

* What you’re using to assess the performance indicator, e.g., Problem 3 in the Final Exam (and give me a copy of Problem 3 or the entire Final Exam)

* The number of students who were assessed — and these should be computer science majors only, but you can assume they all were for those courses

* The breakdown of those assessed students into:

* Excelled: The work demonstrates clear and irrefutable evidence that the student has fully learned and integrated the given skill. 
* Mastered: The work demonstrates sufficient evidence that the student has fully learned the given skill, but perhaps has not integrated it in the context of his or her other computing skills. 
* Partially Mastered: The work demonstrates mixed evidence that the student has learned at least a portion of the given skill. 
* Below Expectations: The work demonstrates no evidence that the student has learned at least any portion of the given skill.

Here’s an example from my database course:

Performance Indicator (z.3): Use Relational Algebra to extract data from a database

Problem 2 from Exam1: “Suppose Student(sid,sname), Faculty(fid, fname) and Advises(fid,sid) are relations. Write a relational algebra expression that finds all the students advised by ‘John Galt’.”

23 computer science majors were assessed.

10 students excelled.
8 students mastered.
4 students partially mastered.
1 student was below expectations.

Just to be clear, you can use “observation during class presentation” or something like that for the assessment item, and you can assess entire teams together, so all 4 students in a team excel. If you have any questions, let me know. This is pretty much top priority. Thanks.

Clear Skies,
Ruben
