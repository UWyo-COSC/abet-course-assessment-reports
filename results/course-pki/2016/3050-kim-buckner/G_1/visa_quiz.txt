5 pts: The H1-B cap is about 65,000 per year, and extensions can add (in
general) up to 3 more years to the initial 3.  That means there is the potential
for up to 390,000 H1-B workers to be legally in the US at one time. Is that a
large enough population of "foreign workers" to really impact the US labor
force? Explain your reasoning.

5 pts:Suppose you are working at a US High Tech firm, what would you think if
the company started to make push toward hiring H1-B workers in your specialty.
Particularly, would you be worried that your job is in jeopardy? Why or why not.

5 pts: The "foreign workers" do not just impact the technology sector. Not only
are there a number of other visa programs but what about education?  We see a
large number of foreign students in colleges and universities and they have a
program by which they can transition from student visa to a "Job Training"
status which can segue to H1-B or 'green card' programs. How do you feel the
general public would respond to the knowledge of that situation? It is not
secret, just not widely advertised. What are your thoughts?

5 pts: One thing that is not mentioned in all the H1-B rhetoric is the fact that
there are high tech (and other) workers that are US citizens who seek positions
in other countries. Instead of allowing this, should not the government insist
that those people stay at home in an attempt to make this whole H1-B issue moot?
