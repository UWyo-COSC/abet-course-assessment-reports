<h1 class="head">The evolution of sexual harassment awareness</h1>

<p>Sexual harassment ranges from annoying to illegal. There was a time 
when it was "accepted" as a form of hazing, the price of being a woman 
in the workplace. Teasing, groping, and worse were often tolerated, as 
was employee termination if a woman didn't provide sexual favors to her 
harasser. That began to change as women sought redress through the 
courts in the 1970s and '80s. A growing body of legal precedents and the
passage of laws strengthening the Civil Rights Act have made the threat
of a sexual harassment lawsuit a serious financial risk for companies 
today. Here's a look at some of the legal moves and high-profile cases 
that have raised awareness of this issue.</p>

<h2>1. The rise of sexual harassment lawsuits</h2>

</div>

<p>Sexual harassment lawsuits started out by taking on quid pro quo 
situations in which a woman lost her job if she would not sleep with her
boss (Barnes v. Train in 1974). The 1978 book "Sexual Shakedown: The 
Sexual Harassment of Women on the Job" by Lin Farley raised the public 
profile of the issue and is often credited with bringing the&nbsp; term 
"sexual harassment" into popular use.</p><p>In 1980 the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/" target="_blank">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) stated that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the <a href="http://artandhistory.house.gov/highlights.aspx?action=view&amp;intID=85" target="_blank">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, issuing regulations that defined the offense. The "hostile environment" legal precedent was set in 1986 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14616838878214701501&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</a>.
Now, sexually charged remarks were grounds for a lawsuit. As a result, 
employers' liability grew, and plaintiffs' burden of proof diminished.</p><p>The<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/cra-1991.cfm" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/cra-1991.cfm" id="__mce_tmp" target="_blank">Civil Rights Act of 1991</a>
expanded the rights of women to sue and collect damages for sexual 
discrimination or harassment. The "reasonable woman" standard entered 
into law in 1991 with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16422690252164027712&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Ellison v. Brady</a>. Cases would now be considered from the point of view of the complainant instead of the defendant.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In 1975, Lois Jenson started working in a mine in northern Minnesota's Iron
Range. Almost from the beginning, according to court documents, Ms. Jenson and
other women were subjected to sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats,
stalking, and intimidation. This behavior has since become known as "strategic"
or "territorial harassment," in this case acts perpetrated by men in a
predominately male workplace.</p><p>In 1984, Jenson wrote a complaint about the
abuse to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The mine's co-owner, Ogelbay
Norton Co., refused the state's request to pay $6,000 in punitive damages and
$5,000 to Jenson for mental anguish.</p><p>In 1988, Jenson's attorney, Paul
Sprenger, filed the United States' first class-action sexual harassment lawsuit
on behalf of Jenson and other women who worked for the mining company. After a
lengthy legal process in which the details of their personal lives were made
public, Jenson and the other plaintiffs were awarded $10,000 apiece in 1996.
However, the judgment was appealed and reversed by the <a
  href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395972/" target="_blank">Eighth Circuit
  Court of Appeals</a> in 1997, and a new jury trial was ordered.</p><p>Just
before the trial was to begin in 1998, 15 women settled with Eveleth Mines for a
total of $3.5 million. The case became the subject of a book entitled "Class
Action" in 2002 and in 2005 was made into a film called "<a
  href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395972/" id="__mce_tmp"
  target="_blank">North Country</a>" starring Charlize Theron.</p>


			 
<h2>3.Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill</h2>

</div>
</div>

<p>Clarence Thomas's confirmation to the US Supreme Court seemed assured until a
report of an FBI interview with former assistant Anita Hill was leaked to the
press. Ms. Hill testified at Mr. Thomas's confirmation hearings in 1991 that,
after she declined to see him socially, he began making sexually suggestive
remarks to her that made her uncomfortable.  Thomas denied the
allegations.</p><p>While Hill's accusations ultimately did not prevent Thomas
from becoming a Supreme Court justice, workplace rights experts say the episode
brought the topic of sexual harassment into everyday conversation, inspiring
much debate about what kind of talk and behavior is inappropriate in the
workplace.</p><p>Soon after Thomas was confirmed, Congress passed a law giving
sexual harassment victims the right to seek federal damages, back pay, and
reinstatement -- a bill that President George H.W. Bush had initially
opposed.</p>


			 
<h2>4. Gen. Larry Smith/Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy </h2>

</div>
</div>

<p>Retired United States Army Lt. Gen. Claudia Jean Kennedy served 31 years in
the military. As the highest-ranking female officer in the Army, she was seen as
a symbol of gender equity in the military. But in 1999, as she was nearing
retirement, fellow officer Gen. Larry Smith was up for promotion to Army deputy
inspector general -- a position in which he would be responsible for
investigating sexual harassment claims.</p><p>When Kennedy found out about
Smith's impending promotion, she decided -- "out of loyalty to the Army"
(according to an Army report about the matter) -- to make known to her superiors
that he was an inappropriate choice for the position. She charged Smith with
touching her in an unwanted sexual manner and kissing her in 1996 when she was a
major general and he was a brigadier general.</p><p>In 2000, the results of an
inquiry by the Army's Inspector General became public: The conclusion was, based
on Kennedy's credibility, that Smith had made wrongful sexual advances to her.
Smith's appointment was withdrawn, and he requested early retirement, expressing
dismay at the Army's decision to substantiate Kennedy's allegations and
insisting that he was innocent of the charges.</p>


			 
<h2>5.Sen. Bob Packwood</h2>

expulsion on sexual and official misconduct charges.<br>(Reuters/File)
</div>
</div>

<p>Bob Packwood, a longtime United States senator from Oregon, resigned in 1995
after at least 29 women (among them campaign workers, congressional aides, and
interns) accused him of sexual harassment and, in some cases, assault. Mr.
Packwood denied the allegations. Despite the fact that the Senate's Ethics
Committee found evidence supporting 17 of the claims, the Justice Department
decided not to prosecute him.</p><p>Reports about the women coming forward
started to hit the news before Packwood's reelection in 1992, but it took 2-1/2
years for the weight of their accusations to lead to Packwood's resignation. The
National Organization for Women (NOW) wanted the charges investigated by the
Ethics Committee before he was officially seated. There were demonstrations, and
in response the Senate leadership announced that the senators were being seated
"conditionally."</p><p>After months of mounting evidence against Packwood, Sen.
Barbara Boxer (D) of California insisted that the Ethics Committee pursue
charges. Finally, for what Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) of Maryland called his
"systematic abuse of women, power, and this Senate," the committee recommended
that Packwood be expelled.</p>


			 
<h2>6.President Bill Clinton/Paula Jones</h2>

</div>
</div>

<p>Despite being the object of a lawsuit and impeached by the House of 
Representatives, then-President Bill Clinton developed a reputation as 
the "Teflon president" for his imperviousness to the repercussions of 
scandal.</p><p>The sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Mr. Clinton
in 1994 by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones never went to 
trial because of her failure to show any damages. After the dismissal of
the lawsuit was appealed, Clinton settled with Ms. Jones out of court 
in 1998 and paid her and her lawyers <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-13/politics/jones.text_1_parties-execution-emotional-distress?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS" target="_blank">$850,000, according to court documents</a>.</p><p>During
the depositions for the Jones case, Clinton was questioned about his 
relationships with employees. He denied having a sexual relationship 
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He was charged with perjury and
obstruction of justice, and subsequently impeached on those grounds by 
the House of Representatives, but not by the Senate.</p>
