[5]The soccer team article layed out a situation where a male coach was
harrassing his players. This is not an unusual situation. Whether it is sexual
or otherwise, coaches (like Bobby Knight), leaders, managers, teachers, and
others in positions of authority often abuse that authority. What should be done
with these people? And how do we protect them from unwarrented claims of
harrassment?


[5]Should military commanders be allowed to decide who gets investigated (and to
what extent) in cases of sexual misconduct? Why or why not?


[5]Should educational institutions be allowed to continue to deal with criminal
acts such as sexual misconduct (or many cases, bullying) without informing the
duly constituted legal authorities? Why or why not?


[5]Where do you think our society (this country, not world-wide) is going in
terms of true equality, of sexes, races, ages, etc.? Are we improving or are we
we just making noise?  Explain.
