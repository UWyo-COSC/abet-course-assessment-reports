[5]Do you think that there are problems that arise today similar to the problem
with the Patriot Missle system during the first Gulf War? If not, why not, if
yes, give a couple of examples of these problems.


[5]Problems can occur with any software system, the more complex the system more
likely there are problems. Given that, who should be held responsible for these
problems? And to what extent? I mean if a stock trader buys software that
directly causes the loss of millions of dollars, is the responsible party liable
for all that? How about a loss of life?

[5]I think there is some Luddite in all of us. But really, do you believe that
automation has cost the workforce jobs? Why/how or why/how not?

[5]When it comes to our health, most of us at least think about the treatments
we get or ask for. We usually find a doctor (or doctors) we trust and stick with
them. What would you do if you found out that your doctor was relying on some
pay-per-use ``expert'' system to do most of her diagnoses? What if she has been
using this system for the past 10 years?
