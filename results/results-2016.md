Outcome  | % Excelled | % Mastered | % Partially Mastered | % Below Expectations | #Student Assessments
:-------:|-----------:|-----------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|------------------------:
(a)      | 45 | 35 | 9 | 11 | 185
(b)      | 60 | 32 | 8 | 0 | 63
(c)      | 58 | 22 | 9 | 11 | 232
(d)      | 53 | 24 | 19 | 4 | 165
(e)      | 98 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 96
(f)      | 67 | 29 | 4 | 0 | 99
(g)      | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0| 48
(h)      | 81 | 10 | 9 | 0| 81
(i)      | 56 | 26 | 10 | 7| 96
(j)      | 42 | 21 | 20 | 17| 66
(k)      | 74 | 8 | 2 | 16| 383

Considering Excelled and Mastered to "Satisfy" each student outcome, we can look at historical trends.

Outcome | %Satisfied 2014-15       | %Satisfied 2015-16       | Change
:------:|-------------------------:|-------------------------:|--------------------------------:
(a)     | 72 | 80 | 8
(b)     | 83 | 92 | 9
(c)     | 79 | 80 | 1
(d)     | 83 | 77 | -6
(e)     | 100 | 100 | 0
(f)     | 89 | 96 | 7
(g)     | 100 | 100 | 0
(h)     | 100 | 91 | -9
(i)     | 91 | 82 | -9
(j)     | 94 | 63 | -31
(k)     | 64 | 82 | 18

As the table shows, the percentage of students who satisfy each outcome is mostly the same in
the two years for which we have data.  The outcomes (j) and (k) show the most difference, and
we attribute this to a better understanding of the assessment process among the faculty, as
opposed to any real change in student performance. We will, of course, continut to monitor
this closely in the next years.

More details of student assessment can be seen by considering the assessment of individual PKIs.

&nbsp;  | (k.4)  |  100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 35

As this table shows, some of the PKIs were not assessed in the current cycle. This is due to a family 
emergency that prevented assessment of COSC 3020 from being complete as of the time of this writing
While this may skew the results a little, the comparisons with last year's assessments lead us to believe that
the final results will be substantially similar.

## Assessment Data

### COSC 1010: Intro to Programming, Allyson Anderson

Core Course                             | KPIs                        | Outcomes
:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------|:--------
COSC 1010: Intro to Programming         | (i.2)                       | (i)

    Performance Indicator (i.2): Program in Java, including use of the Java collections and other useful 
    Java frameworks

    Homework 8:  The salesReport project allows an employee to enter a simple daily sales report and 
    prints out the results. The employee must enter his username and password. After verifying the 
    username and password, the program allows the employee to enter his sales details for the day. 
    Sales details include the product name, product ID#, price, and quantity sold. An object should be 
    created for each product and then added to the daily collection of product objects. When the 
    salesperson is finished entering data, the program calculates the total cash value of the 
    salesperson's sales for the day and prints out the report.

:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------
COSC 4950: Senior Design I              | Every other year, starting 2017-18

This is the first part of the capstone course. Students work in groups
ranging from 3 to 5, and they select a project. In this course, the
students try to flesh out the project, deciding on the important features
and trying to come to terms with project risk.  They decide what technology
to use, and they may start implementation.  They also document their
decisions by writing use cases, or other tools as appropriate (e.g., 
story boards for projects that choose to write games).

Classtime was devoted to group presentations that updated the instructor
and the other teams on the status of the project. This is the main tool
used for assessment.

of the project they started in that class. Students also prepare for the
final presentations, and give a presentation describing their project
to a general audience. Finally, students develop their project using
source code control through github, and they turn in their final projects
by inviting the instructor to the github repository.
