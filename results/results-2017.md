# ABET Assessment Results for AY 2016-17



## Summary

The data for AY 2016-17 was used as part of our continuing improvement process
in the Fall of 2017.

Outcome  | % Excelled | % Mastered | % Partially Mastered | % Below Expectations | #Student Assessments
:-------:|-----------:|-----------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|------------------------:
(a)      | 61 | 10 | 12 | 18 | 104
(b)      | 34 | 39 | 7 | 20 | 146
(c)      | 31 | 62 | 4 | 3 | 296
(d)      | 12 | 84 | 3 | 1 | 215
(e)      | 92 | 6 | 0 | 2 | 200
(f)      | 22 | 54 | 21 | 2 | 129
(g)      | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN| 0
(h)      | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN| 0
(i)      | 70 | 23 | 2 | 5| 43
(j)      | 34 | 17 | 31 | 18| 160
(k)      | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN| 0

Considering Excelled and Mastered to "Satisfy" each student outcome, we can look at historical trends.

Outcome | %Satisfied 2014-15       | %Satisfied 2015-16       | %Satisfied 2016-17       | Last Year Change
:------:|-------------------------:|-------------------------:|-------------------------:|--------------------------------:

(b)     | 83 | 79 | 73 | -6
(c)     | 79 | 80 | 93 | 13
(d)     | 83 | 77 | 96 | 19
(e)     | 100 | 100 | 98 | -2
(f)     | 89 | 96 | 76 | -20
(g)     | 100 | 100 | NaN | NaN
(h)     | 100 | 91 | NaN | NaN
(i)     | 91 | 82 | 93 | 11
(j)     | 94 | 62 | 51 | -11
(k)     | 64 | 82 | NaN | NaN

TODO: As the table shows, the percentage of students who satisfy each outcome is mostly the same in
the two years for which we have data.  The outcomes (j) and (k) show the most difference, and
we attribute this to a better understanding of the assessment process among the faculty, as
opposed to any real change in student performance. We will, of course, continue to monitor
this closely in the next years.

The following graphs show the history of the outcomes (a) through (k).

    Performance Indicator (i.2): Program in Java, including use of the Java collections and other useful 
    Java frameworks

    Homework 8:  The salesReport project allows an employee to enter a simple daily sales report and prints out the results. The employee must enter his username and password. After verifying the username and password, the program allows the employee to enter his sales details for the day. Sales details include the product name, product ID#, price, and quantity sold. An object should be created for each product and then added to the daily collection of product objects. When the salesperson is finished entering data, the program calculates the total cash value of the salesperson's sales for the day and prints out the report. 

    38 students were assessed.
    30 excelled
    5 mastered
    1 partially mastered

      2 student mastered.
      3 students partially mastered.
     17 student was below expectations.
     
     Note: This PKI is being assessed differently than in previous years. We used to assess using mathematical 
     induction, but now we are assessing structural induction in the context of a functional program, which is 
     considerably more difficult. The results are significantly down this year, but we expect that to come back 
     up in future years.
