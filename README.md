# ABET Depot for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Wyoming

This directory contains information about the ABET accredication process for
the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/) at the University of Wyoming. 
Its primary purpose is twofold:

1. *Greater Transparency* by providing a central location where users interested in 
   ABET accredication of our department can see the ongoing process.
2. *Improved Continuity* by allowing all department members and stakeholders to see
   upcoming deadlines and procedures as they prepare for future visits.
